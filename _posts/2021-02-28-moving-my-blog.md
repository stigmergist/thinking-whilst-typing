Decided to move my intermittent blogging over to a simpler system (for me) using GitHub pages.

My old musings still exist at [Mental Hopscotch](https://stigmergist.blogspot.com/) but I want a new, simpler place with more control if I wanted to do some other things.

So I forked [https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and can use PyCharm for git pull/push, etc. for the editing (no local server running - who needs it?) but equally I can just edit directly on GitHub if I want.

Added a comment system using GitHub Issues based on [this](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/jekyll-comment-system-github-issues/) article by Aleksandr Hovhannisyan and Ari Stathopoulos [ideas](https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api) 
*(yes, I know it requires you to have a GitHub login to leave a comment, but that gives me a form of filtering and identity verification for free)*
