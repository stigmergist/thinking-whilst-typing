Decided to move my intermittent blogging over to a simpler system (for me) using GitHub pages.

My old musings still exist at [Mental Hopscotch](https://stigmergist.blogspot.com/) but I want a new, simpler place with more control if I wanted to do some other things.

So I forked https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now and can use PyCharm for git pull/push, etc. for the editing (no local server running - who needs it?) but equally I can just edit directly on GitHub if I want.
